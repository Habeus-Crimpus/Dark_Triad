# Dark Triad Data Science Project Proposal

This repository contains all of the data files, Jupyter notebooks, and any additional files created/used in the development of my
proposal for the Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp final project.

At the moment, the Jupyter notebook file contains some data visualizations, data preprocessing, regression model, and classifiers.

(To be updated once project proposal is more developed)
